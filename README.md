# 2axis_camera_stabilizer_pde4446_week6
This project is an active camera stabilizer that keeps a camera perfectly level, even when it's shaken.  It uses a MPU 6050 to feel any tilt or vibration in real time. The Arduino instantly calculates opposite motion and commands the servos to counteract the shake.
